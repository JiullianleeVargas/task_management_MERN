*The four ? are unused and should be left at default
*The depthMultiplier is left at .1 for both mods I checked out
*Gotta see a bit more how to properly work with the spawnMultiplier
*minDepth is 1-5, the minimum depth of reel distance required for max chance of catching fish




Special Fish ideas:

Wizfish: just a fish with a wizard hat
-Cindersap Forest

Coal Carp: a carp infused with coal
-Mines 20F, 60F

Junimo fish: a fish that only spawns after completing CC
-Secret Woods Pond

Prismatic fish: basically up to par with legendary fish in terms of difficulty
-Witch's Swamp
